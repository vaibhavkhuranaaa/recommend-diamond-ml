# Optimal Diamond Recommendation Model

In a recent data science project, I leveraged R's robust suite of packages to build a machine learning model that recommends optimal diamond purchases. The project commenced with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, focusing on removing outliers, handling missing data, and standardizing variable scales. I then divided the dataset into training and testing subsets for modeling.

Utilizing linear regression, I trained a model and obtained an impressive R^2 value of 96%, demonstrating that the model could explain 96% of the variance in the diamond price. I further tested the model's performance using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a metric, ensuring its robustness.

In the second phase, I enhanced the model using a neural network from the nnet package in R, tuning the number of hidden neurons to optimize performance. This network outperformed the linear regression model, indicating its superior predictive power.

Lastly, I used the developed models to recommend diamonds based on specific price constraints, maximizing carat weight within the budget.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project required a variety of core skills spanning multiple areas of data science and programming, including:

**1. Data Analysis:** A fundamental understanding of statistical methods, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data cleaning techniques were necessary. 

**2. Data Wrangling:** The data had to be cleaned, transformed, and manipulated for appropriate model ingestion. This process involved handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and converting data types.

**3. Machine Learning:** Both linear regression and neural networks were used in this project, illustrating the necessity of understanding these algorithms, how they work, how to interpret their outputs, and how to optimize their parameters.

**4. Programming in R:** Extensive knowledge of the R language was required, particularly in using its various libraries such as dplyr, ggplot2, nnet, and fastDummies. 

**5. Model Evaluation:** The project required an understanding of various metrics to assess the performance of the developed models, including R^2 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

**6. Visualization:** Skills in data visualization using R's ggplot2 were required to interpret the data and model results visually. 

**7. Decision Making:** This project demanded the ability to make informed decisions about model selection and parameter tuning based on the analysis and results.

**8. Problem-Solving:** Lastly, the project necessitated a strong problem-solving mindset to identify, debug, and overcome any issues encountered during the data analysis and modeling phases.
